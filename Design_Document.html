        <h1>Design Documentation</h1>
        <h3>Design Process:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially, I went through all the files provided to me.</li>
            <li>Then I tried various visualization which could be used to display the data.</li>
            <li>Here are some of the rough sketches.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="assets/sketch.jpeg" width="400" , height="600">
        <h3>Design Choices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I decided to extract more csv files from the given files like, “By_Gender”, “By_Age”, these two csv
                files tells about deaths with respect to gender and different age groups respectively. </li>
            <li>I created two different graphs to show the deaths by gender and age.</li>
            <li>Pie chart displayed deaths by different age groups in the data set, while I used bar chart to display
                deaths with respect to gender. </li>
                <li>Both of these charts are linked with London map, Whenever you will hover the mouse on these graph, it will show the data in the map as shown below.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="assets/female.png" width="300", height="350">
            <img src="assets/female1.png" width="300", height="350"><br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>I used blue color to represent "Males" and red color for "Females as these colors can be distinguished easily.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="assets/age.png" width="300", height="350">
            <img src="assets/age1.png" width="300", height="350">
            <ul>
                <li>For age groups, I did not use any color palette of one single color but used the colors which can easily be distinguished, which is clearly seen above.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Below are the two graphs which I tried for my Time line graph:</li>
            </ul>
            
            <img src="assets/time.png" width="300" ,height="500">
            <img src="assets/line.png" width="400" ,height="700"> <br><br>
        
            <ul>
            <li>I have also shown some areas like work house, brewery and various streets like oxford,brewer etc. Here brown circles represent pumps and small black circles shows the location of dead people.</li></ul>
            <img src="assets/MAP.png" width="400" ,height="700">
            <ul>
            <li>My Time line graph is also linked with the map ,when we hover on this, we can see the deaths by particular date.</li></ul>
            <img src="assets/deathByDate.png"  width="500" ,height="500">
        
            </ul>
            <ul>
               
                <li>For all the colors used , I referred to various color design tools like “color brewer” , “color oracle” and
                    "colorgorical"”.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
   
        <h3>Facts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It was clear from the data that people who were in the age group 0-10 over 80 had higher deaths than the
                rest of the age groups. <br>This is because people of these age groups have weak immune system. It is also clear from the visulization below.
            </li>
            <img src="assets/max.png" width=500, height=500>
            <img src="assets/max1.png"  width="500" ,height="500"><br><br>
            <ul>
            </li>
            <li>Also we can see from the map below, that less deaths occurred near the SOHO square, REGENTS Quadrant, CEORGE Street as there were
                no or very few pumps near them so i think people used to carry there own water bottle.</li>
            <li>Maximum deaths were seen at the pump which was in between Workhouse and Brewery, but there were very
                few deaths around these two places, and again at these locations also, i think people used to
                carry there own water bottle.</li>
                </ul>
